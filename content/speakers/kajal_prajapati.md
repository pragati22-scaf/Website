An Occupational therapist with lots of charm and fun on her mind. She believes in empathy and reaching out to the needy, having worked with autistic kids and those suffering from cerebral palsy, it reignited her passion for community work and public health. That brought her to pursuing MPH at SCTIMST. 

A constant caring friend with a penchant for classical dance and embodying skills in dance form: Kathak. She is amazing with a badminton racquet, Bball and great at teaching her friends before exams!
