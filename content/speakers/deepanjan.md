A traveller and foodie by passion and a doctor by profession, Dr Deepanjan joined DM Cardiology at SCTIMST in January 2020 after completing his MD at PGIMER Chandigarh. 

Although he is known for his brilliant academic track record with numerous awards and Gold Medals, along with over 100 publications and presentations, very few are aware of his multiple hobbies including swimming, cooking, art and music, and his awards of Mr Rhapsody in 2010 (MCK) and Mr Zenith in 2019 (PGIMER)
