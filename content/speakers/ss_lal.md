Dr. S.S Lal (Sadasivan Sreemathy Lal) is a leading intellectual from India who has played a seminal role in transforming Public Health internationally. Starting from a humble background, Dr. Lal has shown the way of how any dedicated individual could rise to the international stage and make huge impacts on social service delivery.


His focus was on ensuring the highest quality care delivery in a very limited resource setting. During his stint in East Timor, and later through program implementation in Ethiopia, Zambia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, he applied his hands-on learning to get things done. He was noted for his ability to cut through the bureaucracy with simple innovations. When asked about it, he refers to his background as a humble Indian and how it has contributed to his success abroad in hostile environments.
